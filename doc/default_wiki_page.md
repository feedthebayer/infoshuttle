Hey there! Thanks so much for joining InfoShuttle. I'm sure you are going to LOVE it! Below is some information you may find helpful.

You can change the Wiki Name by clicking on it.
You can change the Page Title by clicking on it.
And, you can even change this text here by... you guessed it, clicking on it!

Your home page (infoshuttle.bayer.ws/) shows all of the wikis that are owned by you. This means that when you upgrade to a Premium account, you can convert any of those wikis to private wikis.

So make yourself at home and look around. If you have any questions, give my a holler @feedthebayer.

Enjoy!
